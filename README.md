In 2022 I decided to try and attempt the Advent of Code, my goal was first to learn vim as well as golang, but while trying to navigate both in a not so quick attempt using 2019's AoC, I decided vim was already challenging enough, so I decided to do vim and Scala, a language I'm a little more familiar with.
