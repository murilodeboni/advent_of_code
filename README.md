# Advent of Code
In 2022 I decided to try and attempt the Advent of Code, my goal was first to learn vim as well as golang, but while trying to navigate both in a not so quick attempt using 2019's AoC, I decided vim was already challenging enough, so I decided to do vim and Scala, a language I'm a little more familiar with.

## Vim config
You can find my `.vimrc` file at vimconfig folder

I wanted to test some plugins so I  also installed pathogen to handle vim plugins, how to install [here](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)

Plugins recommended:
- Malokai colorscheme, more info [here](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/molokai)
- Nerdtree, very helpful for navigating directories in the project, more info [here](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/nerdtree-red) 

Plugins installed but not used:
- Fugitive, for git, [here](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/fugitive-vim) 
- Surround, to help quoting/parenthesizing, didnt quite found situations to use it yet, [here](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/surround-vim)
